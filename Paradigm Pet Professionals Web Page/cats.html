                        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia 
                        region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in 
                        the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat 
                        breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some 
                        diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being 
                        of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat 
                        that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if 
                        possible. Monitor your kitten&apos;s growth closely to make sure its 
                        growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing 
                        at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten 
                        directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons 
                        why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the 
                        following:
                        <ul class="care-list">
                            <li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                            <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
                            <li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Four Week to One Year</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food 
                        typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to 
                        the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">ASPCA</a> 
                        kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry 
                        kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If 
                        your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of 
                        water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized 
                        for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for 
                        growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat 
                        may have different dietary requirements. You should always 
                        consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

                    <h3>One Year to Seven Years</h3>
                    <p>
                        This age is when kittens reach the <em>cat</em> stage and do not need as 
                        many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, 
                        and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> 
                        recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, 
                        provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather 
                        than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the 
                        risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate 
                        and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less 
                        fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you 
                        are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that 
                        states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a 
                        category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, 
                        or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
