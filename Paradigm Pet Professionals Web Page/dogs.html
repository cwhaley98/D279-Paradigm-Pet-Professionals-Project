                        The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a 
                        diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds 
                        recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog 
                        offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite 
                        the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced 
                        feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show 
                        medical indicators such as <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554" target="_blank">reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a> 
                        If you have a dog, it is important to make sure 
                        that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog 
                        and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you 
                        will find more information about how to care for your pets 
                        throughout the various stages of their lives.

                    <h3>Diet & Exercise</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout dogs&apos; lifespans, they should generally be fed 
                        fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first 
                        two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are 
                        about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be 
                        reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year 
                        old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. 
                        And a dog&apos;s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 
                        and 70 percent water. The ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in 
                        body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, 
                        so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity 
                        to keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. 
                        The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with 
                        breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30&#8210;120 
                        minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine 
                        exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother 
                        some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me 
                        cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are 
                        being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! 
                        You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical 
                        activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose 
                        a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require 
                        supervision.

                    <h3>Grooming & Handling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. 
                        So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and 
                        prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely 
                        difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, 
                        especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only 
                        important to your dog&apos;s health but can be an exercise depending 
                        on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse <strong>all</strong> of the soap out, as any 
                        residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated 
                        for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. 
                        And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter 
                        the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your 
                        canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one 
                        hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. 
                        If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms 
                        perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest 
                        and rear as you lift.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Vaccinations & Medicaitons</h3>
                    <p>
                        You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian, 
                        but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. 
                        Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, 
                        rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet 
                        depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these 
                        include <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet" target="_blank">Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>
